## v0.8.4 (2026-09-12)

### New Features

- **Scene music tools** (Closes #93)
  - `get-current-scene` and `list-scenes` now include each scene's music binding (`playlist` / `playlistSound` with ids + names)
  - `update-scene-music`: set or clear the binding by id or unique name; writes through `scene.update()` with the core `playlist` / `playlistSound` fields so it syncs to connected clients without a reload. Validates both ids exist before writing; a sound cannot be bound without its parent playlist.

- **Playlist management + playback tools**
  - `manage-playlists` (`create` | `update` | `delete` | `describe`): playlist CRUD on any system; `create` accepts sounds inline (`path` required, plus `name`, `volume`, `repeat`, `fade`); `update` patches playlist fields and/or individual sounds matched by exact id or unique path/name within the playlist; `delete` matches by exact id or name only, never partial; `describe` with no identifier lists all playlists compactly, with an identifier returns the full document including every sound
  - `control-playlist`: `play` (playAll), `stop` (stopAll), `cycle-mode` (sequential -> shuffle -> soundboard), plus per-sound `play-sound` / `stop-sound` - all through the client Playlist API so the server and every connected client stay in sync
  - Both are GM-only (same silent GM validation as every other bridge tool) and system-agnostic

- **ActiveEffect management** (#102)
  - `manage-effects` (`create` | `update` | `delete`): works on effects owned by an actor or by one of its items, with the parent scoped so an effect cannot be mutated through the wrong one
  - `search-character-items` with `type: "effect"` now covers item-owned effects as well as actor-owned ones, each tagged with `scope`, `parentItemId` and `parentItemName`
  - `get-character-entity` resolves items, actor-owned effects and item-owned effects, returning the complete document
  - Items are serialised from `item.toObject()`, so dnd5e Activity data is preserved rather than dropped

- **DSA5 system support** (#81)
  - DSA5 adapter with `normalizePayload` / `describeActorSchema`, plus system detection
  - New `replace-journal-page` tool

- **`manage-actors` gains `place`** (#85) — place existing world actors onto the current scene, rather than only newly created ones

- **Information notifications setting** (#99) — Foundry-side notifications can now be turned off; on by default

### Fixes

- **`use-item` failed outright on Foundry V13/V14** (#105) — it called `game.user.updateTokenTargets`, which is not a supported public API on those versions, so passing `targets` (including `"self"`) aborted the whole operation. Targeting now goes through `Token#setTarget()`, resolves token ids, token names and actor names, and no longer aborts item use when a target cannot be applied — the result reports what succeeded.

- **Windows installer could destroy an existing ComfyUI install on upgrade** (#103) — upgrades now detect a prior installation via `InstallLocation`, a legacy `UninstallString`, or the historical default path; reuse that directory; skip the directory page; and leave an existing ComfyUI directory untouched. `DisplayVersion` is derived from the build rather than hardcoded, and `UninstallString` is written quoted.

- **Large responses timed out over WebRTC** (#89, fixed in #101) — the data channel was created with `maxRetransmits`, making it only partially reliable, so a dropped chunk left the receiver waiting forever for something that would never arrive. The channel is now fully reliable, chunks are paced against the send buffer instead of being dumped into SCTP at once, and a failed reassembly now rejects the waiting query instead of surfacing as a generic timeout.

- **Five defects in `dnd5e-add-feature`** (#91) — stale skill and ability defaults among them

- **Journal page rename** (#95, fixed in #100)

- **`list-dsa5-archetypes` returned nothing** (#77, fixed in #83) — the tool called a `getPackIndex` query that was never registered on the module, and each failure was swallowed, so it reported success with an empty list

- **Scene background lost after `generate-map`** (#79)

- **Map job deduplication ignored the scene name** (#80, fixed in #84) — two jobs differing only by scene name collapsed into one

- **WebSocket loopback regression** (#74, fixed in #82) — `ws://` is used for loopback hosts even on HTTPS pages

- **Module settings CSS leaked** (#97) — `.form-footer` rules are now scoped to the module's own settings forms

### Internal

- Version consistency is now checked in CI across all five manifests (#72), guarding against the drift behind #69
- Release-notes tool count and system list corrected (#71)

## v0.8.3 (2026-08-09)

### New Features

- **Mongoose Traveller 2e (mgt2e) System Support**
  - `list-creatures-by-criteria` now works on mgt2e worlds: filters by hit points, psionics, creature type, and actor type; indexed metadata includes characteristic DMs (STR/DEX/etc.)
  - `search-compendium` extracts mgt2e-relevant stats (hits, behaviour, species, tonnage) from search results
  - `manage-world-items` gains a new `describe` action that returns a live enum reference for mgt2e item fields (weapon traits, scales, armour forms, hardware system discriminators, software classes, etc.) — call it before creating items to get valid keys

- **`manage-actors` — generic actor CRUD tool** (works on any game system)
  - `create`: create one or more actors of any type with arbitrary `system` data; mgt2e convenience: accepts skill shorthands (`{ pilot: 2 }`), lowercase characteristic keys, and `system.details` remapped to `system.sophont`
  - `update`: patch existing actors by ID; mgt2e skill shorthands normalised server-side (avoids Electron module-cache issue that prevented browser-side normalisation)
  - `delete`: delete actors by ID
  - `update-items`: update embedded items on an actor by item ID
  - `delete-items`: delete embedded items from an actor by item ID

### Fixes

- `getIndex()` now uses the return value rather than `pack.indexed` state, fixing compendium indexing on Foundry v13 where `pack.indexed` behaviour changed

  - Character extraction: 10 characteristics, wounds, fate/fortune, resilience/resolve, corruption, career/species/class, skills, and arcane/divine spellcasting
  - `get-character` / `list-characters` / `search-character-items` now work on WFRP4e worlds

### Fixes

- **macOS installer** (PR #54): the Claude Desktop config is now merged rather than overwritten, preserving any other configured MCP servers; more robust logged-in-user detection; postinstall scripts no longer abort on a non-critical failure; additional Foundry data-dir locations probed
- **Node 26 install failure** (Issue #51, reported by @frankyh75): removed the unused `better-sqlite3` dependency, which failed to build against Node 26's V8 ABI

    - Targets set via Foundry's targeting system before item use

- **Search Character Items Tool** (`search-character-items`)
  - Token-efficient item search within a character's inventory
  - Filter by type (weapon, spell, feat, equipment, etc.)
  - Filter by category (items, spells, features, all)

## v0.4.17 (2025-09-09)

- Wrapper/backend architecture: convert MCP entry to a thin stdio wrapper that proxies to a singleton backend over `127.0.0.1:31414`.
- Backend singleton + lock: backend binds Foundry connector on `31415` and creates `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-backend.lock`.
- Startup race fix: resolves Claude Desktop duplicate-start race by keeping wrappers alive and ensuring only one backend owns ports.
- Runtime stability: backend now bundled (`dist/backend.bundle.cjs`) and preferred by wrapper for reliable startup in installer environments.
- Shared package now emits JS + d.ts, ensuring runtime availability for both dev and installer.
- Logging: wrapper writes to `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-server\wrapper.log`; backend logs to `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-server\mcp-server.log`.
- Installer: enhanced staging to include full server `dist`, bundled wrapper `index.cjs`, bundled backend, and `node_modules/@foundry-mcp/shared`.
- Build scripts: added root convenience scripts (`build:release`, `bundle:server`, `installer:stage`); NSIS script accepts `--skip-download` and `--skip-nsis` for staging-only runs.

Notes

- No changes needed for CI; existing workflows continue to build bundles and the installer.
- Foundry MCP Bridge port remains `31415`. Control channel is `31414` (internal wrapper↔backend only).
